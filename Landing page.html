        <h1>Kenny Watson!</h1>
        <p>Hello all! My name is Kenny and I'm from Kansas City MO (Woooo!) It has been a long time coming and I am thrilled to finally to be able to get started. I started to learn how to code in high school and a little bit every once in a while but I always get side tracked by various things that are going on. For more information like and follow my Facebook page to keep updated.</p>

      <h2>A little more about me</h2>
        <p> I'm currently a bassist for the Jose Ramirez Band based in the Tampa Bay area. I'm also a freelance session player in the Twin Cities Metro as well as Kansas City Metro. I have always been a creative being and LOVE to be able to share and create with other likeminded people. I hope to get to work someday with coding. Thanks for listening!</P>
